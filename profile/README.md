## 🧭 Overview

The **DayZ ESP Tool** transforms your screen into a tactical display — tracking every entity across Chernarus and Livonia. Using an external DirectX overlay, it operates fully outside the game memory, offering safe use even in online sessions.

With custom filters for players, items, and threats, you can adapt visibility to your exact survival goals.

> [!NOTE]
> ESP mode is 100% passive — no aimbot, no file modification, only visual awareness.
